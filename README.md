SMTP-Bootstrap-Contact-Form
===========================

I built this Bootstrapped PHPMailer contact form for anyone looking for one to quickly add to their website. This configuration is setup to use SMTP, but you can easily change that with the provided PHPMailer examples in the PHPMailer folder.
